## Installation (Local Development)

1. Clone or download this repository:

---

## Usage

1. Click the **Subtitle Downloader Pro** icon in the browser toolbar.

## How It Works

- The popup UI collects the user’s search query.  
- The query is sent to the background service worker.  
- The service worker communicates with the OpenSubtitles REST API and fetches matching subtitles.  
- When a result is selected, the service worker triggers a direct SRT download.[web:21]
